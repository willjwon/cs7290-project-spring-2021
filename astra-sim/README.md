### Setup Instructions ###

```bash
# Clone the repository
$ git clone https://github.com/astra-sim/astra-sim.git

# cloning the submodules
$ cd astra-sim
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update
```

#### Instructions for compiling & running Garnet2.0 as the network simulator
1. Run "./build/astra_garnet/build.sh -c" to compile and integrate astra-sim with gem5 (-l flag will clean the compilation). This will create a binary file where garnet is integrated with astra-sim. The analytical backend is hosted at  https://github.com/georgia-tech-synergy-lab/gem5_astra .
2. Run an example inside the "examples/" directory with garnet as a backend. Example: "examples/run_allreduce.sh -n garnet". This command will run a single all-reduce collective on a Torus topology. 
3. The results of example script runs will be dumped inside "examples/results/" path.

#### Instructions for compiling & running analytical backend as the network simulator
1. Run "./build/astra_analytical/build.sh -c" to compile and integrate astra-sim with gem5 (-l flag will clean the compilation). This will create a binary file where analytical backend is integrated with astra-sim. The analytical backend is hosted at https://github.com/astra-sim/analytical .
2. Run an example inside the "examples/" directory with garnet as a backend. Example: "examples/run_allreduce.sh -n analytical". This command will run a single all-reduce collective on a Torus topology. 
3. The results of example script runs will be dumped inside "examples/results/" path. 

#### Instructions for compiling & running NS3 as the network simulator
Coming Soon!

NOTE: The on-screen reported delays (no matter what backend is used) after the end of simulation are in cycles while the delays inside the csv files are in terms of microseconds.

#### ASTRA-SIM Binary Command Line Options
When running the binary file (no matter what backend is used), the following options may be passed to the binary file (see example scripts):

**--network-configuration (required):** The network input file dir.

**--system-configuration  (required):** The system input file dir.

**--workload-configuration (required):** The workload input file dir.

**--path (required):** The path to dump the results.

**--run-name  (required):** Name of the current run.

**--num-passes  (required):** Number of training passes to simulate.

**--total-stat-rows (required):** Total number of runs that want to write to the same csv file (please see run_multi.sh inside the "examples/"" directory). This is useful when multiple runs want to write to the same csv file. This value should be 1 if only 1 run is executed. 

**--stat-row  (required):** The position of the run to write its stats into the csv stat files (please see run_multi.sh inside the "examples/"" directory). This is useful when multiple runs want to write to the same csv file. This value should be 0 if only 1 run is executed.

**--compute-scale (optional):** Scales the all compute times (reported in the workload input file) by this scale. Tge default value is 1.

**--comm-scale  (optional):** Scales the all communication sizes (reported in the workload input file) by this scale. Tge default value is 1.

NOTE: The garnet+astra-sim binary also allows all of the network input options be overridden by the command line options.
